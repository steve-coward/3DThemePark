This is a C++ application that draws a 3D scene of a simple theme park using openGL.
The terrain uses a height map with a texture created from four base terrain textures.
Rides include a ferris wheel, roller coster, and a spinning carousel type of ride.
Other features include bridges, trees and a fence.  The roller coster uses a spline to
corm the track and also includes a wooden support structure.  The spinning ride can
be subdivided by the viewer to create a round dome at the center of the ride.  The fence
is based on a .x file defining the fence mesh.
